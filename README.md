# Ride Sharing Analysis

## Resources
 - Software: Python 3.8.8, Jupyter-notebook : 6.3.0
 - Dataset: [city_data.csv](https://github.com/cffhr99/Module5-Challenge/blob/main/Resources/city_data.csv) 
            [ride_data.csv](https://github.com/cffhr99/Module5-Challenge/blob/main/Resources/ride_data.csv)
            
## Overview
The purpose of this project it to perform analysis of Pyber ride sharing data to get an understanding of ridesrship and fare metrics by the types of cities. A visualizations of rideshare data can help improve the ridershare service and make analysis easier to understand.

## Results
Through analysis, the table below is the summary for each city type.
![City Types Summary](https://github.com/cffhr99/Module5-Challenge/blob/main/Resources/fare_type_summary.PNG?raw=true)
According to the summary for each city type:
1. Urban cities have the highest ridership and rural cities have the least.
2. Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver.
3. Only Urban cities have a higher average fare per driver than average fare per ride.

## Summary
Based on the analysis, the recommendations are :
1. Increasing the drivers in Rural areas to ensure that there are enought drivers to meet ride demand.
2. Increasing the drivers in Suburban areas to ensure that there are enought drivers to meet ride demand.  
The reason is that higher average fare per ride and driver from Rural and Suburban areas indicates that most rides in these areas are long-distance rides. Increasing drivers in these two areas can reduce the loss of rides in peak time.
